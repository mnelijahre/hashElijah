    Yet here they shall not lie for catching cold.
  JULIA. I see you have a month's mind to them.
  LUCETTA. Ay, madam, you may say what sights you see;
    I see things too, although you judge I wink.
  JULIA. Come, come; will't please you go?                Exeunt




SCENE III.

  PANTHINO. I think your lordship is not ignorant
    How his companion, youthful Valentine,

  ANTONIO. I kno
